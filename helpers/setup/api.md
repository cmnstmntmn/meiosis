## app

Application object.

Type: [Object][25]

### Properties

-   `initial` **[Object][25]?** an object that represents the initial state.
    If not specified, the initial state will be `{}`.
-   `Actions` **[Function][26]?** a function that creates actions, of the form
    `update => actions`.
-   `services` **[Array][27]&lt;[Function][26]>?** an array of service functions, each of which
    should be `state => patch?`.
-   `Effects` **[Function][26]?** a function that creates effects, of the form
    `(update, actions) => [effects]`, which each effect is `state => void` and calls `update`
    and/or `actions`.

## meiosis.common.setup

Base helper to setup the Meiosis pattern. If you are using Mergerino, Function Patches, or Immer,
use their respective `setup` function instead.

Patch is merged in to the state by default. Services have access to the state and can return a
patch that further updates the state. State changes by services are available to the next
services in the list.

After the services have run and the state has been updated, effects are executed and have the
opportunity to trigger more updates.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **[StreamLib][28]** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property. The
    returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `accumulator` **[Function][26]** the accumulator function.
-   `combine` **[Function][26]** the function that combines an array of patches into one.
-   `app` **[app][29]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Object][25]** `{ states, update, actions }`, where `states` and `update` are streams, and
`actions` are the created actions.

## StreamLib

Stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`, `m.stream`, or anything for
which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream` function to create a stream. The
function or object must also have a `scan` property. The returned stream must have a `map`
method.

Type: ([Object][25] \| [Function][26])

### Parameters

-   `value` **any?** the stream's initial value.

### Properties

-   `stream` **[Function][26]** the function to create a stream, if the stream library itself is
    not a function.
-   `scan` **[Function][26]** the stream library's `scan` function.

Returns **[simpleStream][30]** the created stream.

## meiosis.mergerino.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with [Mergerino][31].

### Parameters

-   `stream` **[StreamLib][28]** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `merge` **[Function][26]** the Mergerino `merge` function.
-   `app` **[app][29]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Object][25]** `{ update, states, actions }`, where `update` and `states` are streams,
and `actions` are the created actions.

## meiosis.functionPatches.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with function patches.

### Parameters

-   `stream` **[StreamLib][28]** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `app` **[app][29]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Object][25]** `{ update, states, actions }`, where `update` and `states` are streams,
and `actions` are the created actions.

## meiosis.immer.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with [Immer][32].

### Parameters

-   `stream` **[StreamLib][28]** the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
    `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
    function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
    The returned stream must have a `map` method.
-   `produce` **[Function][26]** the Immer `produce` function.
-   `app` **[app][29]** the app, with optional properties.

Returns **[Object][25]** `{ update, states, actions }`, where `update` and `states` are streams,
and `actions` are the created actions.

## meiosis.preact.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with [Preact][33].

### Parameters

-   `h` **preact.h** the Preact h function.
-   `useState` **preact.useState** the Preact useState function.
-   `Root` **preact.Component** your Root component, which receives `state`, `update`, and
    `actions`.

Returns **preact.Component** the top-level component to which you pass `states`, and either
`update`, `actions`, or both.

## meiosis.react.setup

Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with [React][34].

### Parameters

-   `React` **React** the React instance.
-   `Root` **React.Component** your Root component, which receives `state`, `update`, and
    `actions`.

Returns **React.Component** the top-level component to which you pass `states`, and either
`update`, `actions`, or both.

## simpleStream

A simple stream.

Type: [Function][26]

### Parameters

-   `value` **any?** emits a value onto the stream. When not specified, returns the
    stream's latest value.

### Properties

-   `map` **[Function][26]** creates a new stream for which the values from the original stream
    are processed by the passed-in function and emitted onto the new stream.

## meiosis.simpleStream.stream

Creates a stream.

### Parameters

-   `initial` **any?** the stream's initial value.

Returns **[simpleStream][30]** the created stream.

## meiosis.simpleStream.scan

Creates a new stream that starts with the initial value and, for each value arriving onto
the source stream, emits the result of calling the accumulator function with the latest
result and the source stream value.

### Parameters

-   `accumulator` **[Function][26]** a two-parameter function, the result of which is emitted
    onto the returned stream.
-   `initial` **any** the initial value for the returned stream.
-   `sourceStream` **[simpleStream][30]** the source stream from which values are processed by the
    accumulator function.

Returns **[simpleStream][30]** the created stream.
