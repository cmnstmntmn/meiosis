/**
 * Helper to setup the Meiosis pattern with [Immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer).
 *
 * @function meiosis.immer.setup
 *
 * @param {StreamLib} stream - the stream library. This works with `meiosis.simpleStream`, `flyd`,
 * `m.stream`, or anything for which you provide either a function or an object with a `stream`
 * function to create a stream. The function or object must also have a `scan` property.
 * The returned stream must have a `map` method.
 * @param {Function} produce - the Immer `produce` function.
 * @param {app} app - the app, with optional properties.
 *
 * @returns {Object} - `{ update, states, actions }`, where `update` and `states` are streams,
 * and `actions` are the created actions.
