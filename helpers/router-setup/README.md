# meiosis-router-setup

Coming soon.

<!--
[Meiosis](https://meiosis.js.org) is a pattern, not a library. Nevertheless, in response to popular
demand and for your convenience, here are some reusable snippets of code that help setup and use
Meiosis. This module provides support for setting up a router. Out-of-the-box support is provided
for these router libraries:

- [feather-route-matcher](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/feather-route-matcher)
- [Mithril Router](https://mithril.js.org/route.html)

## Installation

Using `npm`:

```
npm i meiosis-router-setup
```

Using a `script` tag:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/meiosis-router-setup"></script>
```

Using the `script` tag exposes a `MeiosisRouterSetup` global, under which the helper functions are
provided:

- `createFeatherRouter`
- `createMithrilRouter`

## Using `meiosis-router-setup`
